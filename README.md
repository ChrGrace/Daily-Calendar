# Daily-Calendar
A calendar allowing the user to save events for each hour of the day, running in the browser.

# Description:

A simple daily planner that features the current time and date, and allows the user to input data into the hour slots and then save that data so they can plan their activities and work.
The hours are colour coded, with the current hour being highlighted.

I think. The hours I'm able to work on this are outside of the scope of the project hours we had to use as per the instructions...but I think it works.


# Languages used:
HTML, CSS, JSS and love.

# Installation:
N/A as the application is entirely usable from the browser.

# Usage:

The user can tell the time and date in the top left of the screen.
They can also input data into each of the hourly slots, and if they so desire, click the save button to register that information in the local browser so that it persists even if they close the browser.
